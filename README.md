# IOT_NB-IOT_GSM_CORE

Hi
I want to upload different type of GSM, NB-IoT module from different companies like Quectel, Simcom, AI thinker
and build a stand-alone IoT device without using microcontrollers or AT commands.just with the modules complete your Iot project.

Quectel M66, bc66, and bc66-NA have Opencpu SDK.It's awesome. it has different example like gpio , MQTT , SSL/TLS
and AI thinker module has a SDK too

you can use this module without microcontroller in smart gadgets easily
